# EUROPEAN ENERGY TRANSITION ANALYSIS PROJECT (TABLEAU)

Project developed while working on Bootmap data analysis at [IronHack](https://www.ironhack.com/us/en/data-analytics), the objective is to analyze the European energy transition in the countries that make up the EU by analyzing how the use of polluting raw materials has given way to cleaner forms of energy over the years 2000 to 2021.

## Project Description & Project goals

This project has been the first in which Tableau has been used for the visualization of the results, for which we have started from a data set available on the [Ember website](https://ember-climate.org/data-catalogue/yearly-electricity-data/)

This dataset contains yearly electricity generation, capacity, emissions, import and demand data for over 200 geographies. Data is collected from multi-country datasets (EIA, Eurostat, BP, UN) as well as national sources (e.g. China data from the National Bureau of Statistics).

We select the energy generation and emissions data, which are the ones that will be useful to perform our analysis only for the 27 EU countries, between the years 2000 and 2021, so once our dataset is cleaned, we import it into Tableau.
